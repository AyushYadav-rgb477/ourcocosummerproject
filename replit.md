# CollabFund - Student Collaboration and Funding Platform

## Overview

CollabFund is a web-based platform designed for college students to share their creative projects, secure funding, and collaborate with peers. The platform enables students to showcase innovative ideas, connect with potential collaborators, and receive financial support for their projects.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend served by Flask
- **Design Pattern**: Multi-page application with separate HTML files for different sections
- **UI Framework**: Custom CSS with Font Awesome and Bootstrap Icons for visual elements
- **Navigation**: Single-page application feel with JavaScript-driven navigation and dynamic content loading

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Structure**: Modular design with separate files for app configuration, models, and routes
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints under `/api/*` prefix with CORS enabled
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions with configurable secret key

### Database Architecture
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with Flask-SQLAlchemy extension
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configurable via DATABASE_URL environment variable)
- **Schema Design**: Relational model with proper foreign key relationships and cascading deletes

## Key Components

### User Management System
- **Authentication**: Username/password-based authentication with secure password hashing using Werkzeug
- **User Model**: Stores user profile information including username, email, full name, and college affiliation
- **Session Handling**: Server-side session management for maintaining user state

### Project Management System
- **Project Model**: Core entity storing project details including title, description, category, funding goals, and status
- **Project States**: Active, completed, and paused project statuses
- **Funding Tracking**: Current funding vs. funding goal tracking

### Collaboration Features
- **Comments System**: User-generated comments on projects with author relationships
- **Voting System**: User voting mechanism for project popularity
- **Collaboration Tracking**: Many-to-many relationships between users and projects
- **Donation System**: Financial contribution tracking between users and projects

### Frontend Pages
- **Landing Page**: Hero section with typewriter effect and feature showcase
- **Authentication Pages**: Separate login and registration forms with modern UI
- **Browse Page**: Project discovery with filtering and search capabilities
- **Dashboard**: User-specific project management and collaboration overview

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via login form
2. Flask backend validates credentials against database
3. Session is created and stored server-side
4. Frontend JavaScript checks authentication status and updates UI accordingly

### Project Management Flow
1. Authenticated users create projects via dashboard
2. Projects are stored in database with owner relationships
3. Projects appear in browse section for discovery
4. Users can interact with projects through comments, votes, and collaboration requests

### Funding Flow
1. Users discover projects through browse functionality
2. Donation system tracks financial contributions
3. Project funding progress is updated in real-time
4. Project owners can monitor funding status through dashboard

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Libraries
- **Font Awesome 6.5.0**: Icon library for consistent visual elements
- **Bootstrap Icons 1.11.3**: Additional icon set for UI components

### Backend Dependencies
- **Flask**: Core web framework
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM integration
- **Flask-CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing support
- **Werkzeug**: Security utilities for password hashing and proxy handling

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database system with connection pooling and health checks
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database abstraction layer with declarative models

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- **Database**: Configurable via DATABASE_URL environment variable with fallback to local PostgreSQL
- **Security**: SESSION_SECRET environment variable for session encryption
- **Development**: Debug mode enabled with hot reloading

### Server Configuration
- **WSGI**: ProxyFix middleware for proper header handling behind reverse proxies
- **Static Files**: Flask serves static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) from `/static` directory
- **CORS**: Enabled for `/api/*` endpoints to support frontend-backend separation

### Database Management
- **Schema Creation**: Automatic table creation on application startup
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling with 300-second recycle time and pre-ping health checks
- **Model Relationships**: Proper foreign key constraints with cascading delete operations

### Scalability Considerations
- **Session Storage**: Server-side sessions (may need external session store for scaling)
- **Static Assets**: Served directly by Flask (consider CDN for production)
- **Database Connections**: Connection pooling configured for concurrent users
