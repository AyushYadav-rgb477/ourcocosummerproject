🌙 Global Dark Theme
Apply a global dark background (#0d0d0d) and light text (#ffffff) across the entire page.

Use a clean, modern sans-serif font (e.g., 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', or system UI fonts).

2. 🧭 Navigation Bar Styling (Match Homepage)
Use the same purple gradient or solid color used on the homepage navigation bar (#6a0dad or equivalent).

Ensure navigation links (Home, Browse Projects, Discussion, etc.) are:

White (#ffffff) by default.

Highlighted in gold (#ffd700) on hover.

Buttons like Login and Register should match the homepage in:

Style (white background, purple text, rounded).

Hover state (gold background, dark text).

3. 📦 Containers & Cards (Consistent UI)
All side widgets (e.g., "Trending Topics", "People You May Know", "Active Now") and discussion cards should:

Have a dark gray background (#1a1a1a).

Use subtle box shadows for elevation.

Feature rounded corners (at least 12px radius).

Maintain consistent padding and margins as seen on the homepage.

4. 🗂️ Tabs and Filters
Style all filter buttons (e.g., "All Posts", "Polls", "Help", etc.) using:

Dark background (#2e2e2e), white text.

Rounded-pill buttons.

Active/hover state in gold (#ffd700) with black text.

5. 💬 Post Input and Messages
Style the "Join the conversation" text box as follows:

Background: #1a1a1a

Border: 1px solid #333

Rounded edges and internal padding.

Prompt messages (e.g., "Login or Register to post") should:

Have a dark background box.

Feature an info icon and text in white/yellow.

Use gold links for login/register calls to action.

6. 🧡 Reactions
Implement a LinkedIn-style reaction bar using emojis/icons like:

👍 Like, 👏 Celebrate, 💡 Insightful, 💬 Curious, ❤️ Support.

Use hover states (slight scale-up, gold color) for visual feedback.

7. ✅ Accessibility & Consistency
Ensure high contrast between background and text for readability.

Use consistent spacing, sizing, and class naming conventions used in the rest of the site.

Do not modify the existing CSS files directly — use new scoped styles or override classes as needed.
